<P>This tutorial describes how to develop a Java applet/application
incorporating the XIPC Java network client package
<A HREF="../API/index.html">xipc30</A>.
It starts with a
simple console based Java client/server application and compares it
to a C application. It discusses the differences between a Java applet
and a Java application as it pertains to the Java Xipc. Finally,
it gives some suggestions on how to handle data marshalling.</P>

<P>Before proceeding with the tutorial, it is necessary to have the
proper environment for developing and testing the software. This
consists of three separate software packages:</P>

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="http://www.envoytech.com/products/downloads.html">
	Version 3.0 of the Xipc software.</A></LI>
	<LI>Java Xipc package, com.envoytech.xipc30.</LI>
	<LI>JDK 1.1.8 or higher from <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/">java.sun.com</A>.
	</LI>
</UL>

<P>It is assumed that the user already has JDK installed
on their system.</P>

<P>Throughout this tutorial the word <i>instance</i> is used quite frequently.
The word is mainly used in two contexts. In the first context, instance
refers to the Xipc instance that is running on a particular machine. In
the second context, instance refers to the instance of an object as used
in OOP. When reading this tutorial, it is important to distinguish the
contexts in which the word is used.</P>

<P>The Java application is a simple console based client/server
echo program where the client sends a message to the server
and the server echoes the message back to the client. The server
also displays the message on its console. This sample program
utilizes message queues to exchange messages between the client and
the server. It demonstrates the QueSys portion of the Xipc software
package but the general concept can also be applied to memory
segments (MemSys portion of Xipc) and semaphores (SemSys portion of
Xipc).</P>

<P>The role of the server program is to log into an Xipc instance,
create two message queues (que1 and que2), and wait for a message
from the client on que1. When a message is received on que1, the
server displays the message on the console and sends it back to the
client on que2. This cycle repeats until the client sends a
&quot;quit&quot; message at which time the server destroys the queues,
logs itself out of the Xipc instance, and exits the program.</P>

<P>The role of the client program is to log into the same Xipc instance
that the server is logged in to, get the queue IDs of the two queues
that were created by the server, and wait for a user message. When the
user types in a message, the message is sent on que1 and waits for the
echoed message on que2. When the message is received on que2, the
client displays the echoed message on the console and waits for
another message from the user. This cycle repeats until the user
types the &quot;quit&quot; message at which time the client sends
this message to the server, logs itself out of the Xipc instance, and
exits the program.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The server program is called
<A HREF="../samples/server.java">server.java</A>.
The program performs the following operations
pertaining to XIPC:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Create an Xipc object.</LI>
	<LI>Log into an Xipc network instance.</LI>
	<LI>Create two message queues (que1 and que2).</LI>
	<LI>Build two separate que ID lists (qlist1 and qlist2).</LI>
	<LI>Wait for a message from the client using qlist1.</LI>
	<LI>Display the message on the console.</LI>
	<LI>If message is &quot;quit&quot; then</LI>
	<OL>
		<LI>Destroy the two queues.</LI>
		<LI>Log out of the Xipc instance.</LI>
		<LI>Exit program.</LI>
	</OL>
	<LI>Send the message back to the client using qlist2.</LI>
	<LI>Repeat steps 5 to 8.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The server constructs an Xipc object. Xipc is the class
which contains all the methods and constants that are defined for
Java Xipc.</P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>Xipc x = new Xipc();</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>The server logs into the Xipc instance with the user name of
&quot;server&quot; by calling </P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>x.XipcLogin(args[0], "server");</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>The instance name is passed as a command line argument when the
server program is invoked. The instance name is of the form</P>

<UL>
	<P><B>@&lt;Host Name&gt;:&lt;Instance Name&gt;</B></P>
</UL>

<P>where &lt;Host Name&gt; is the name of the machine that the
Xipc instance is running on and the &lt;Instance Name&gt; is the
name of the Xipc instance that was specified when the Xipc instance
was started.</P>

<P>The server creates two queues (que1 and que2) by calling</P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>int qid1 = x.QueCreate("que1", 1, 128);
int qid2 = x.QueCreate("que2", 1, 128);</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>The queues are defined to hold a maximum of one message or a
maximum of 128 bytes. The server uses que1 to receive and que2 to
send messages.</P>

<P>The queue IDs are needed to build the queue ID lists. A queue ID list
defines a list of queues that the QueSend and QueReceive operations are
to act upon. Since QueSend and QueReceive act on different queues, two
separate queue ID lists are needed (qlist1 and qlist2). Queue ID lists
are built using</P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>QidList qlist1 = Xipc.QueListBuild(qid1);
QidList qlist2 = Xipc.QueListBuild(qid2);</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>The QueListBuild returns a QidList object with one
element in the list. If additional elements are to be added to the
list, then QueListAdd can be used.
Once the queue ID lists are built, it is possible
to invoke QueSend and QueReceive operations.</P>

<P>The server waits for a message from the client by calling </P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>int length = x.QueReceive(Xipc.QUE_Q_EA, qlist1, buf,
				  80, retprio, retqid,
				  Xipc.QUE_WAIT);</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>It waits for the earliest arrived message on qlist1 by specifying a
queue select code of Xipc.QUE_Q_EA. The wait is accomplished by
specifying an option of Xipc.QUE_WAIT. When a message is
received, QueReceive stores the message in a byte array and returns
the length of the message that was received. The byte array is
converted to a Java String object and is displayed on the console. </P>

<P>If the message received is not &quot;quit&quot;, then the server
echoes the message back to the client by calling </P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>x.QueSend(Xipc.QUE_Q_ANY, qlist2, buf, length,
		 1000, retqid, Xipc.QUE_NOWAIT);</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>This time the queue select code is set to Xipc.QUE_Q_ANY and the
option is set to Xipc.QUE_NOWAIT.</P>

<P>If the message received is &quot;quit&quot;, then the server
destroys the two queues that it created by calling</P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>x.QueDestroy(qid1);
x.QueDestroy(qid2);</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>It then logs itself out of the Xipc instance by calling</P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>x.XipcLogout();</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>and exits the program.</P>

<P>Here is the entire source code for the server program,

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The client program is called
<A HREF="../samples/client.java">client.java</A>
and the major steps pertaining to Xipc are as follows:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Create an Xipc object.</LI>
	<LI>Log into an Xipc network instance.</LI>
	<LI>Obtain the queue IDs of the two message queues that were
	created by the server (qid1 and qid2).</LI>
	<LI>Build two separate que ID lists (qlist1 and qlist2).</LI>
	<LI>Wait for a message from the user. If the message length is
	greater than 0, then send it to the server using qlist1.</LI>
	<LI>If the message is &quot;quit&quot; then</LI>
	<OL>
		<LI>Log out of the Xipc instance.</LI>
		<LI>Exit program.</LI>
	</OL>
	<LI>Wait for the echoed message from the server using qlist2.</LI>
	<LI>Display the message on the console.</LI>
	<LI>Repeat steps 5 to 8.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Like the server program, the client constructs an Xipc object</P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>Xipc x = new Xipc();</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>and logs into the same Xipc network instance that the server is logged into
by calling </P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>x.XipcLogin(args[0], "client");</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>The instance name is passed as a command line argument when the
client program is invoked.</P>

<P>The client gets the queue IDs of the two queues (que1 and que2) that
were created by the server by calling</P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>int qid1 = x.QueAccess("que1");
int qid2 = x.QueAccess("que2");</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>The client uses que1 to send and que2 to receive messages.</P>

<P>Again, the queue IDs are needed to build the queue ID lists. A queue
ID list defines a list of queues that the QueSend and QueReceive
operations are to act upon. Since QueSend and QueReceive act on
different queues, two separate queue ID lists are needed (qlist1
and qlist2). Queue ID lists are built using</P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>QidList qlist1 = Xipc.QueListBuild(qid1);
QidList qlist2 = Xipc.QueListBuild(qid2);</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>The QueListBuild returns a QidList object with one
element in the list. If additional elements are to be added to the
list, then QueListAdd can be used.
Once the queue ID lists are built, it is possible
to invoke QueSend and QueReceive operations.</P>

<P>When the user types in a message, the client converts the text
message, which is a String object, to an array of bytes.</P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>userInput.getBytes(0, userInput.length(), outbuffer, 0);</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>If the message length is greater than 0, the client sends the
message to the server using </P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>x.QueSend(Xipc.QUE_Q_ANY, qlist1, outbuffer, length,
		 1000, retqid, Xipc.QUE_NOWAIT);</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>QueSend operates on qlist1 with a queue select code of
Xipc.QUE_Q_ANY.  This implies any queue in qlist1 which in this
case is que1 since that is the only queue in the list. Priority
is set to 1000 and a XintRef object is passed for return
queue ID. An option of Xipc.QUE_NOWAIT is used so that the
method returns immediately if there is no space in the queue.</P>

<P>If the message that the user typed is not &quot;quit&quot;,
the client waits for the return echo by invoking </P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>length = x.QueReceive(Xipc.QUE_Q_EA, qlist2, inbuffer,
			 80, retprio, retqid,
			 Xipc.QUE_WAIT);</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>QueReceive operates on qlist2. It uses a queue select code of
Xipc.QUE_Q_EA, which implies the earliest arrived message.
XintRef objects are passed for both the return priority and the
return queue ID. An option of Xipc.QUE_WAIT implies that the method
must wait until it receives a message from the server.</P>

<P>If the message that the user typed is &quot;quit&quot;, the
client logs out of the Xipc instance by calling</P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>x.XipcLogout();</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>and exits the program.</P>

<P>The Xipc Java API is very similar to the Xipc C API in terms of
constant definitions and argument layout. The major change was in
converting pointer data types in C to classes in Java. Also, a couple of
new classes are defined in Java to facilitate the method
invocations.</P>

<P>The table below shows how the C data types were converted to Java
classes and two additional classes that are created for Java API.</P>

</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>Three classes (<I>MidList</I>, <I>QidList</I>, and <I>SidList</I>)
are defined in Java for constructing the ID lists of MemSys,
QueSys, and SemSys. These lists construct the data in a format
that is required by Xipc. The maximum number of items that can
be put into <I>MidList</I>, <I>QidList</I>, and <I>SidList</I>
are 8, 8, and 32 respectively.</P>

<P>Two addtional classes, <I>Section</I> and <I>MsgSelectQid</I>,
are defined to facilitate the construction of <I>MidList</I> and
<I>QidList</I> respectively. <I>Section</I> is used by MemSys
operations to create memory section objects which divide a
memory segment area into various sections. <I>MsgSelectQid</I>
is used by QueSys operations to select a particular message
among various queues.</P>

<P>An <I>XintRef</I> class is defined in Java API to
represent (XINT *) in C API. A (XINT *) is used in C to return
XINT values. Likewise <I>XintRef</I> object is used in Java to
return integer values. <I>XintRef</I> defines two methods</P>

<UL>
<PRE><B>setValue(int x);
getValue();</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>which set and get the value of the XintRef object.</P>

<P>The methods that have changed most significantly from their
C counterparts are the ID ListBuild and ID ListAdd operations.
Unlike the C API operations where the elements of the list can
all be passed in a single function call, the Java API operations
accept only one element at a time. Furthermore, the ListBuild
methods must be called first to build the list object with the
first element in the list and the ListAdd methods must be called
subsequently in order to add any other elements to the list.</P>

<P>The ListBuild operations return the list objects
so it is not necessary to specify a list object as one of the
parameters to the ListBuild operations. However, the ListAdd
operations operate on an existing list object so the ID list
object must be passed as one of the parameters.</P>

<P>Here are the C source codes for the
<A HREF="../samples/client.c">client</A> /
<A HREF="../samples/server.c">server</A> example
that was presented earlier. A comparison between the C code
and the Java code shows the similarity in how the Xipc methods
are used.</P>

<P>In order to create an executable program, the C source codes
must be compiled and linked with the nxipc.lib and nxipctcp.lib
library files.<P>

<P>The Java Xipc API connects to Xipc instances via Java sockets.
This implies that the Xipc instance must be a network instance.
Java applets/applications will not work with standalone Xipc
instances.</P>

<P>Furthermore, due to the restrictions placed on the applet, an
applet can only log into an Xipc instance that is running on the
same machine as the one where the applet was downloaded from.
Attempting to log into an Xipc instance that is running on another
machine will generate a Security Exception from the Java virtual
machine. A Java application, of course, does not have this
restriction.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In Xipc, all the data transmissions happen at the
byte level. Therefore, every data must be converted to a byte
stream before they can be sent or received via Xipc. In
<I>QueSend</I>, <I>QueReceive</I>, <I>MemWrite</I> and
<I>MemRead</I> methods, the buffers that the methods
operate upon are byte arrays.</P>

<P>The programmer must flatten out objects and convert the
various data types to a byte array before invoking <I>QueSend</I>
or <I>MemWrite</I>. Likewise, the programmer must reconstruct
the various data types and objects from a byte array after
invoking <I>QueReceive</I> or <I>MemRead</I>.</P>

<P>In the example, the client program converts the userInput
String object to a byte array as follows

<UL>
<PRE><B>userInput = is.readLine();
userInput.getBytes(0, userInput.length(), outbuffer, 0);
length = userInput.length();</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>before invoking <I>QueSend</I>.</P>

<P>Conversely, the server program converts the byte array
to a String object as follows

<UL>
<PRE><B>String msg = new String(buf, 0, 0, length);</B></PRE>
</UL>

<P>after invoking <I>QueReceive</I>.</P>
