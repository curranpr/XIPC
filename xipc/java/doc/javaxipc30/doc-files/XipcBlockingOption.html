<h2>Using Blocking XIPC Methods</h2>
<h3>Blocking options</h3>
<p>All <i>XIPC</i> methods that have the potential to block have a <i>BlockOpt</i> parameter that 
is used to specify the appropriate option for the method call.
<p>The blocking option parameter accepts one of the 
following values, as listed below. The characters
&quot;<I>XXX</I>_&quot; should be replaced by &quot;SEM_&quot;, &quot;QUE_&quot; or &quot;MEM_&quot;
depending on the subsystem being operated on.
	<DL>
		<DT><I>XXX</I>_NOWAIT
		<DD>When the blocking option is <I>XXX</I>_NOWAIT, if the request specified by the method
			cannot be immediately satisfied, the method returns immediately with return code
			equal to XipcErr.<I>XXX</I>_ER_NOWAIT.</LI>
		<DT><I>XXX</I>_WAIT
		<DD>When the blocking option is <I>XXX</I>_WAIT, if the request specified by the method
			cannot be immediately satisfied, the thread invoking the method is blocked until
			the request is completed.</LI>
		<DT><I>XXX</I>_TIMEOUT(<I>t</I>)
		<DD>When the blocking option is <I>XXX</I>_TIMEOUT(<I>t</I>), </LI> if the request specified by 
			the method cannot be immediately satisfied, the thread invoking the method is blocked until
			the request is completed, or until <I>t</I> seconds have elapsed after which the function 
			returns with return code equal to XipcErr.<I>XXX</I>_ER_TIMEOUT.
