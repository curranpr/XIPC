<h2>Using Message Select Codes and Queue Select Codes</h2>

<p>QueSys provides the systems developer with great flexibility in sending and receiving messages. It is this
feature that most sets QueSys apart from existing message queueing facilities. The key to successful 
utilization of QueSys is a good understanding of when and how to use the various message and queue select codes. 
This section offers a brief tutorial that describes these 'whens and hows'. 

<p>All QueSys operations that dispatch or retrieve messages to and from QueSys queues require a <i>QueSelectCode</i> 
and a <i>QidList</i> argument. It is the combination of these two arguments that determines the destination queue 
of dispatched messages, as well as the identity of retrieved messages. It is therefore essential to understand the 
function of these two arguments and how they interact. 

<p>This document uses a shorthand notation for writing <i>QueSelectCode</i> and <i>QidList</i> argument specifications.
Using this shorthand it is possible to examine and explore the open-ended possibilities afforded to the systems 
developer. Instead of formally describing the shorthand notation, the document makes extensive use of examples. 

<h3>Dispatching Messages Onto QusSys Queues</h3>

<p>The topic of dispatching messages via QueSend is examined first, since it is less complex than the retrieval of 
messages. 

<p>Dispatching messages onto QueSys message queues can be viewed as occurring in two steps: 
<ul>
	<li>First, a list of one or more queues is defined.</li>
	<li>Then, the message is placed onto one of the queues in the list, depending on some criteria.</li>
</ul>

<p>As an example, consider a programmer who wishes to send a message onto the shortest queue of the list of 
queues a, b, and c (perhaps to guarantee balanced queue loads). First, the programmer would define the queue 
list {a, b, c}, and then specify the 'Shortest Queue' criteria together with the queue list when dispatching 
the message using the QueSend or QuePut function calls. Using a shorthand notation, this can be easily 
expressed as: 
	<pre>QUE_Q_SHQ{a, b, c}</pre> 
Similarly, the expression for sending a message onto the longest queue in the list would be: 
	<pre>QUE_Q_LNQ{a, b, c}</pre> 

<p>The syntax for such dispatch expressions is thus of the form: 
	
	<p><tt>QueSelectCode{</tt><i><tt>QidList</tt></i><tt>}</tt> 

<p>The different possible <i>QueSelectCode</i>s that may be used to dispatch a message using QueSend are: 
<ul>
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_SHQ - The shortest queue.</li>
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_LNQ - The longest queue.</li>
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_HPQ - The queue having the highest priority message.</li>
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_LPQ - The queue having the lowest priority message.</li>
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_EAQ - The queue having the earliest arrived (oldest) message.</li>
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_LAQ - The queue with the latest arrived (most recent) message.</li>
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_ANY - The first queue in the list that has room (not full).</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of their usage include: 
<ul>
	<li>QUE_Q_LPQ{x, y, z} - Place the outgoing message on one of the queues x, y or z, having the 
		lowest priority message.</li>
	<li>QUE_Q_EAQ{q, r, s} - Place the outgoing message on one of the queues q, r or s, having the 
		earliest arrived (oldest) message. This selects queues in a 'least recently accessed' manner.</li>
	<li>QUE_Q_LAQ{m, n} - Place the outgoing message on one of the queues m or n, having the latest 
		arrived (most recent) message.</li>
	<li>QUE_Q_SHQ{j, k, m} - Place the outgoing message on the shortest of the three queues j, k or m. 
		This achieves queue balancing.</li>
	<li>QUE_Q_ANY{a, b, c} - Place the message on the first of the queue a, b or c that has room for 
		another message. The queues are examined in the order of specification.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Retrieving Messages from QueSys Queues</h3>

<p>Retrieving messages in the QueSys system can similarly be viewed as occurring in two steps, but with 
a minor variation: 
<ul>
	<li>First a list of message queues is defined by the program. As part of this definition, one message 
		is designated as the 'candidate message' for each of the listed queues, using a <i>MsgSelectCode</i>. 
		For example, the specification 
			<pre>{QUE_M_HP(a), QUE_M_EA(b), QUE_M_LA(c)}</pre> 
		defines a list of three queues <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b>, where the candidate messages are: 
		<ul>
			<li>QUE_M_HP(a), the highest priority message on queue a.</li>
			<li>QUE_M_EA(b), the earliest arrived message on queue b.</li>
			<li>QUE_M_LA(c), the latest arrived message on queue c. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Using the Java API, this list could be built as follows (assuming <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b> 
		are <tt>int</tt> queue ids):
		<pre>
QidList ql = Xipc.QueListBuild(Xipc.QUE_M_HP(a));
Xipc.QueListAdd(ql, Xipc.QUE_M_EA(b));
Xipc.QueListAdd(ql, Xipc.QUE_M_LA(c));
		</pre>
		Or, in a more object oriented fashion:
		<pre>
QidList ql = new QidList().QueListAdd(Xipc.QUE_M_HP(a)).QueListAdd(Xipc.QUE_M_EA(b)).QueListAdd(Xipc.QUE_M_LA(c));
		</pre>
		</li>
	<li>A message then gets selected from the list of candidate messages using a <i>QueSelectCode</i>. The 
		selected message is retrieved and returned to the calling function. Thus, for example, the specification 
			<pre>QUE_Q_HP{QUE_M_EA(a), QUE_M_EA(b)}</pre> 
		compares the oldest (earliest arrived) messages on queue <b>a</b> and queue <b>b</b> and returns the one 
		with the higher priority. Similarly, the specification 
			<pre>QUE_Q_EA{QUE_M_HP(x), QUE_M_HP(y), QUE_M_HP(z)}</pre> 
		returns the oldest of the highest priority messages from queues <b>x</b>, <b>y</b> and <b>z</b>.</li>
</ul>	 
<p>Now consider another retrieval example having a slightly different twist: 
	<pre>QUE_Q_LNQ{QUE_M_HP(a), QUE_M_HP(b), QUE_M_HP(c)}</pre>
The interpretation of this expression is as follows: First, the highest priority message on the three respective 
queues <b>a</b>, <b>b</b> and <b>c</b> are designated as candidate messages. The returned message is that 
candidate message which resides on the longest queue.
 
<p>Note that the 'QUE_Q_LNQ' QueSelectCode when used in a candidate message selection capacity chooses the candidate 
message that resides on the longest queue of <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b>. This is a departure from the 
message retrieval examples demonstrated until now where the candidate message selection processes were based on 
a 'QueSelectCodes' that compared the designated candidate messages from each queue directly, one with the other. 
Here, by contrast, the message selection is performed based on characteristics of the underlying queues. 

<p>The possible <i>MsgSelectCode</i>s are listed below. 
<ul>
	<li>Xipc.QUE_M_EA(<i>Q</i>) - The earliest arrived (oldest) message on the queue <i>Q</i>.</li>
	<li>Xipc.QUE_M_LA(<i>Q</i>) - The latest arrived (most recent) message on the queue <i>Q</i>.</li>
	<li>Xipc.QUE_M_HP(<i>Q</i>) - The highest priority message on the queue <i>Q</i>.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_M_LP(<i>Q</i>) - The lowest priority message on the queue <i>Q</i>.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_M_PREQ(<i>Q, n</i>) - The first message on queue <i>Q</i> having a priority of <i>n</i>.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_M_PRNE(<i>Q, n</i>) - The first message on queue <i>Q</i> <i>not</i> having a priority of <i>n</i>.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_M_PRGT(<i>Q, n</i>) - The first message on queue <i>Q</i> with a priority greater than <i>n</i>.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_M_PRGE(<i>Q, n</i>) - The first message on queue <i>Q</i> with a priority &gt;= <i>n</i>.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_M_PRLT(<i>Q, n</i>) - The first message on queue <i>Q</i> having a priority less than <i>n</i>.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_M_PRLE(<i>Q, n</i>) - The first message on queue <i>Q</i> with a priority &lt;= <i>n</i>.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_M_PRRNG(<i>Q,n,m</i>) - The first message on queue <i>Q</i> with a priority in [<i>n,m</i>] range.</li> 
</ul>

<p>The possible <i>QueSelectCode</i>s that can be used for selecting a candidate message from one of the listed 
queues during retrieval operations are those listed below. Beware of some of their differing interpretations 
as compared to their usage within message dispatch operations. 
<ul>
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_EA - The earliest arrived (oldest) candidate message.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_LA - The latest arrived (most recent) candidate message.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_HP - The highest priority candidate message.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_LP - The lowest priority candidate message.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_LNQ - The candidate message from the longest queue in the list.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_SHQ - The candidate message from the shortest queue in the list.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_HPQ - The candidate message from the queue with the highest priority message.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_LPQ - The candidate message from the queue with the lowest priority message.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_EAQ - The candidate message from the queue with the earliest arrived message.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_LAQ - The candidate message from the queue with the latest arrived message.</li> 
	<li>Xipc.QUE_Q_ANY - The first candidate message.</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Expression Simplification</h3>

<p>Expression simplification can be employed in certain cases. Simplification is straight-forward, involving simple 
defaults. 

<p>Whenever a message retrieval <i>QidList</i> has an entry in which a MsgSelectCode is not provided for a given queue 
(i.e., only the Qid is given), then the retrieval operation's QueSelectCode is employed as the message select 
criteria for that given queue. 

<p>The following examples demonstrate this concept. The following two message retrieval expressions are equivalent: 
	<pre>QUE_Q_HP{QUE_M_HP(x), QUE_M_EA(y), QUE_M_HP(z)}</pre>
	<pre>QUE_Q_HP{x, QUE_M_EA(y), z}</pre> 

<p>They both consider three candidate messages: 
<ul>
	<li>The highest priority message on queue <b>x</b>.</li>
	<li>The earliest arrived message on queue <b>y</b>.</li>	
	<li>The highest priority message on queue <b>z</b>.</li> 
</ul>

<p>The candidate message having the highest priority is the one retrieved. 

<p>Note that the first and third Qids of the simplified expression lack a <i>MsgSelectCode</i>. As a result they 
inherit the criteria of the expression's <i>QueSelectCode</i> (Highest Priority). 

<p>Similarly: 
	<pre>QUE_Q_HP{QUE_M_HP(q), QUE_M_HP(r), QUE_M_HP(s)}</pre>
	<pre>QUE_Q_HP{q, r, s}</pre> 
Both of these retrieval expressions return the overall highest priority message found on the three queues <b>q</b>, 
<b>r</b> and <b>s</b>. 

<p>Another case deserving review is how the expression <i>QUE_Q_HP{q, r, s}</i> returns the highest priority message 
of all three queues <b>q</b>, <b>r</b> and <b>s</b>. This is accomplished as follows, considering the un-simplified 
form of the expression: 
	<pre>QUE_Q_HP{QUE_M_HP(q), QUE_M_HP(r), QUE_M_HP(s)}</pre> 
First, the candidate messages from the three queues <b>q</b>, <b>r</b> and <b>s</b> are designated. They are the 
highest priority message of their respective queues. These three candidate messages are then compared and the 
highest priority message of the three candidates is chosen. 

<p>Note, therefore, that a <i>QidList</i> of the form <i>{q, r, s}</i> can be used interchangeably within 
message dispatch and retrieval functions. 

<h3>Priority Specification During Retrieval</h3>

<p>A number of the <i>MsgSelectCode</i>s deal with priorities. A variety of priority values or ranges can be specified. 

<p>Thus, for example, 
	<pre>QUE_Q_EA{QUE_M_PREQ(a, 100), QUE_M_PRLT(b, 50)}</pre> 
designates the first message on queue <b>a</b> having a priority of 100 as the candidate message of queue 
<b>a</b>, and the first message on queue <b>b</b> having a priority less than 50 as the candidate message 
of queue <b>b</b>. It then returns the earliest arrived (oldest) of these two candidate messages. 

<p>Similarly, 
	<pre>QUE_Q_LNQ{QUE_M_PRRNG(a, 100, 200), QUE_M_PRRNG(b, 100, 200)}</pre> 
considers the first message on queue <b>a</b> having a priority in the range [100,200] and it does the same 
for queue <b>b</b>. It then returns the candidate message from the longer of the two queues. 

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This tutorial has outlined a few guidelines and examples of how to dispatch and 
retrieve messages to and from queues within the <i>XIPC</i> QueSys subsystem. The possible combinations 
are almost endless, well beyond what can fit in this documentation. These examples and the shorthand used 
to express them should provide a good starting point for using the system correctly and to its full potential.
